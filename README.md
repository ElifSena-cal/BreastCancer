# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project

This project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using an artificial intelligence model. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Desktop Application

A desktop application was developed using Tkinter to allow users to make requests and get predictions. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input data and receive diagnostic results.

## API for Model Training

An API was created using Flask to enable users to train the model. The trained models are saved in a directory, and when a user wants to make a prediction, the most recently trained model is used.

## Mobile Application

For the mobile version of this project, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/ElifSena-cal/BreastCancerDiagnosisMobileApp).

## Features

- **Dataset:** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
- **Desktop Application:** Built with Tkinter to allow users to input data and get predictions.
- **API for Model Training:** Created with Flask to enable model training and saving the trained models.
- **Prediction:** The most recently trained model is used for making predictions.
